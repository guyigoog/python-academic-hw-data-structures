Python-language academic homework on data structures
# Description
In the project we learned about common data structures: queue, stack, linked lists and binary trees.
We learned when to use each of them and how.
In the project we built a class of monomers and through it we built a class of polynomials (monoms in a linked list). We apply mathematical operations to the polynomials such as: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivative, integrals and comparisons.
We learned to implement the polynomials using a binary search tree and perform search, add, remove and sort operations on the tree.
